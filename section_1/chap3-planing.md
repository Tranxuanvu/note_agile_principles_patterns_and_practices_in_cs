SWAG: scientific wild-assed guess

### Initial exploration
Dont try to identify all the features. As the project proceeds, the customers will continue to discover more features.
The flow of features will not shut off until the project is over.

As a feature is identified, it is broken down into one or more user stories (can use a card). Not much info is written in the card, except
the name of the user story (e.g. login, add user, delete user, change password). We aren't try to capture details at this stage.

We simply want st that remind us the conversation we've been having about the features.

The developers work together to estimate the stories. The estimates are relative, not absolute. We write a number of points on a story card
to represent cost of the story. We may not sure just how much time a story point represents, but we do know that a 8 points story will take
twice as long as a 4 points.

Developer tends to underestimate large stories and overestimate small ones.
Too big story should be split into pieces that aren't too big. Any story that is too small should be merged with other small stories.

When a story is split or merged, it should be reestimated.

After 3-4 weeks (actually iterations), we'll have a good idea of our average velocity. We can use it to predict how much work we'll get
done in subsequent weeks. Tracking velocity is one of the most important tools in XP project.

At the start of a project, the developers will not have a very good idea of their velocity. The must create an initial guess by whatever
means they feel will give the best results. The need for accuracy at this point is not particular grave, so they don't need to spend an
inordinate time on it.

### Release planing

Given a velocity, the customers can get an idea of the cost of each of the stories, as well as its business value and priority. This
allows the customers to choose the stories they want to do first. This choice is not purely matter of priority. St that is important but
also expensive may be delayed in favor of st that is less important but much less expensive. Choices like this are _business_ decisions.

The developers and customers agree on a date for the first release of the project. This is usualy a matter of 24 months in the future.
The customers pick the stories they want to implemented with in that release and rough order they want them implememted in. The customers
cannot choose more stories than will fit according to the current velocity. Since the velocity is initially inaccurate, this selection is
crude. But accuracy is not very important at this point. The release plan can be adjusted as velocity becomes more accurates.

### Iteration planing

Iteration size
Customers choose the stories they want to implemented in the first iteration but can not choose more stories than will fit according
to the velocity.

The order of stories within an iteration is a technical decision.
The customer cannot change the stories in the iteration when it has begun. Customers are free to change the order any story in the project
but not the ones that the developers are currently working on.

The iteration ends on the specified date, even if all stories aren't done. The estimates for all the completed stories are totaled, and
the velocity of the interation is calculated. The measure of velocity is then used to plan the next iteration.

This feedback about velocity helps to keep the planning sync with the team. If the team gains expertise and skill, the velocity will rise
commensurately. If someone is lost from the team, the velocity will fall. If an architecture evolves that facilitates development,
the velocity is rise.
