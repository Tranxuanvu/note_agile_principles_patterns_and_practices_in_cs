tiny increments, how can you ever design the software
the big picture evolves along with the software.
the team doesn't spend very much time looking ahead to future requirements and needs.
nor does it try to build in today the infastructure to support the feature that may be needed tmr.

how do we know whether the design of a software system is good?
these symptoms:
- regidity: difficult to change
- fragility: easy to break
- immobility: difficult to reuse
- viscosity: difficult to do the right thing
- needless complexity: over design
- needless repetition
- opacity

Agile team apply SOLID principle to solve smells, they don't apply principles when there are no smells
