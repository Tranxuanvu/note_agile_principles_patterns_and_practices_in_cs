A set of UML may represent parts of the design, but those diagrams are not the design. In the end, the source code is the design.

Redesign rarely succeed. Shooting the moving target

Agile developers know what to do because they follow these steps:

- They detected problem by following agile practices.
- They diagnosed the problem by applying design principles.
- They solved problem by applying an approriate design pattern.

Keep the design as good as it can be


Agile developers are dedicated to keeping the design as approriate and clean as possible. Agile developers do not "clean up" the design
every few weeks. Rather, they keep the software as clean, simple, and expressive as they possibly can every day, every hour, and every
minute. They never say "We'll go back and fix that later". They never let the rot begin.

Agile developers doesn't apply those principles and patterns to a big, up-front design. Rather, they are applied from iteration to
iteration in an attempt to keep the code, and the design it embodies, clean.
